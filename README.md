# Hello and welcome to my portfolio!

I'm Vaishnavi Jangili, a passionate Data Scientist with a Master’s in Data Science and over two years of hands-on experience turning complex data into valuable business insights. Through my work in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning, I've helped businesses make informed decisions, optimize performance, and achieve meaningful results.

This space highlights my journey—showcasing the projects I've worked on, the skills I've honed, and the impact I’ve created using tools like Python, SQL, and Power BI.

When I’m not immersed in data, I enjoy exploring the outdoors on long walks and trying out new recipes in the kitchen. Dive in, explore, and feel free to connect!
